# sample-personal-website
a fresh sample website (this is my first official website)

the original plan is to create a personal website of my own. i work mostly on data
and i have no major background on web dev nor on html/css. but i actually tried
learning html & css years ago for my friendster profile. but i wasn't sucessful.
come 2009/2010, i tried learning it again for my tumblr profile
but the design i really want was too complex. i was able to create a very simple
tumblr layout but it was really very basic. come 2021, i tried creating
using python via flask (coz i was learning python at a time). for some reason,
the ides i downloaded was a bit messed up so i scrapped that.

this ai age of 2025, i plan to continue it again. this repository is 100%
made by me. i am aware of the different ai tools but i used claude to craft
me an 8-day learning plan. as i type this, this is day 1.

i hope this simple project of mine will help boost my overall software
development knowledge and skills. (also i'm still getting used to github haha)

thank you for reading! ^_^
